# Strategies for researching jQuery

I've had some previous experience before with jQuery and JavaScript through some other online classes I have taken, but one resource which I find great is Jon Duckett's JavaScript/jQuery book.  Very easy to use and understand.  Plus there are pretty colors and the pages feel nice!

I think in reviewing this book, it helped me to solidify the differences between JavaScript and jQuery.  I still have a lot to learn, but now that I'm more comfortable with the system, I think it's going to be less confusing and more enjoyable.

I must admit, I am terrible about getting up when the Pomodoro timer goes off.  If I feel like I'm on a roll, I just go with it.  I do get stuck every once in a while, but I think that if I paced myself more it I could potentially go for a longer period of time.  I definitely need to work on this.  I actually read an article that basically said that when working, the best ratio work to break is 58 minutes to 17 minutes of break, or more or less 1 hour to 15 minutes.

The plan for this assignment was just to read Jon Duckett's book for 2 hours and practice on the pages I created in this folder.  Well, went over by about 1.5 hours :-S.  It is fun that is for certain, but I do tend to burn out after a while, and then I need a longer break from coding, like for about a week or so (eek).

On a separate note, my commits are definitely not as good as I would like them to be.  Committing messages are not very descript, most likely because I'm used to working on my own.  I know I definitely need to practice pull requests for sure along with cloning, forking, and rebasing repos.
