# Strategies for researching jQuery

I've had some previous experience before with jQuery and JavaScript through some other online classes I have taken, but one resource which I find great is Jon Duckett's JavaScript/jQuery book.  Very easy to use and understand.  Plus there are pretty colors and the pages feel nice!

I think in reviewing this book, it helped me to solidify the differences between JavaScript and jQuery.  I still have a lot to learn, but now that I'm more comfortable with the system, I think it's going to be less confusing and more enjoyable.
