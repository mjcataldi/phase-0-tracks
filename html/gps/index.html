  <!--Reflection
  The purpose of semantic tags are they create meaning for the user and document and make styling easier.  Good for accessibility programs and different devices such as mobile devices.  The most useful ones are the ones that are most specific.
  
  The order that the browser uses to display elements is top to bottom.  Heading tags are assigned to certain sections e.g. h1 is more important than h2.  Nested elements give depth to the elements.
  
  I use Cloud9 and I learned that it is definitely different that Sublime.  Snippets are a bit different and bring up different sets of structures.  Editing them will be fun, but finding the defaults are proving to be difficult.
  
  The concept of scope was a bit challenging for me.  I've had some experience with scope, but it relates to variables, but my partner in crime just explained it to me so I get it now!
  
  Extra Notes:  I'm still experimenting around with Snippets in the Cloud9 environment.  The latest https://c9.io/roboweaver/c9-snippets/ where this guy seems to have an add-on for it, but I'm still trying to figure out how to install the darn thing.
